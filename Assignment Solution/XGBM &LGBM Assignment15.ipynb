    "## 1. Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "survived = train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 1]: This line creates a new DataFrame called survived containing only the rows from the original train_df where the 'Survived' column has a value of 1 (indicating passengers who survived).\n",
    "\n",
    "not_survived = train_df[train_df['Survived'] == 0]: Similarly, creates a new DataFrame not_survived containing rows where 'Survived' is 0 (passengers who didn't survive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculation and Printing:\n",
    "\n",
    "len(survived): Calculates the number of rows in the survived DataFrame, representing the count of survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "len(not_survived): Calculates the number of rows in the not_survived DataFrame, representing the count of non-survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "len(train_df): Calculates the total number of rows in the original train_df, representing the total number of passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "float(len(survived))/len(train_df)*100.0: Calculates the percentage of survivors by dividing the number of survivors by the total number of passengers and multiplying by 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "float(len(not_survived))/len(train_df)*100.0: Calculates the percentage of non-survivors similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The print statements then display the calculated counts and percentages in a formatted manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code calculates and prints the number and percentage of survivors and non-survivors in the given train_df dataset. It's likely part of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) process to understand the distribution of the 'Survived' variable in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "train_df is a Pandas DataFrame containing information about passengers, including a 'Survived' column with values 0 (not survived) and 1 (survived).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The %.1f format specifier in the print statements ensures that the percentages are displayed with one decimal place.\n",
    "This code provides a basic overview of the survival rate but doesn't offer any insights into the factors affecting survival. Further analysis would be required to explore relationships between survival and other variables in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Survived: 342 (38.4%)\n",
    "Not Survived: 549 (61.6%)\n",
    "Total: 891\n",
    "This output indicates that 342 passengers survived (38.4% of the total), while 549 did not survive (61.6%)."
